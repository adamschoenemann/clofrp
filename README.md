For my master's thesis at ITU

## TODO
- Support higher-kinded types (should be not that hard)
- Check/infer lambdas with annotated type-params
- Parse and desugar multi-param lambdas
- Optimize type-checking in general
- Make sure everything is sane by checking context-wellformedness more and checking that no impredicativeness takes place
- Add the actual CloTT primitives and rules
- Support (co)-inductive and guarded types
- Implement primitive recursion and guarded recursion 
- Think of a module strategy
- Integrate with Haskell
- Write a demo (Pong or Pacman if crazy)
